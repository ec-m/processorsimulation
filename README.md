# processorsimulation

The program simulates a simplified processor after the von Neumann
architecture. The components of the processor are reduced to the CU, RAM, ALU,
Accu and the PC. A user can enter commands or load small programs whose
execution is then visualized by the GUI.

The project was written by Andreas Rist, Daniel Muszkiet and myself as part of
the course "Software Engineering" by Prof. Dr. Klaus Ostermann at the
University of Tuebingen, Germany in 2015. I wrote the parser for user input,
which can parse 12 different commands in binary, hexadecimal and assembly, such
as a reduced C compiler.

For further details please see the documentation, which is currently only
available in German.
